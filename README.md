## Overview

Welcome to this Stock Price Direction Prediction Repository! This repository provides a highly useful classes that leverages deep learning for performing classification tasks for stock price prediction problem. The end-to-end class is designed to facilitate the entire workflow of the classfication or regression approach to stock price prediction, including data downloading, adding technical indicators, adding macro-economic data, data cleaning, feature engineering, dataset splitting, model training, hyperparameter tuning, clustering, and establishing feature importance.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Automatically handles missing values, outliers, and other common data issues.
- **Feature Engineering:** Includes built-in functions for feature selection, transformation, and creation.
- **Model Training:** Supports training on deep learning models using tensorflow.
- **Dataset Splitting:** Efficiently splits datasets into training and testing sets.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** .
- **Feature Importance:** Establishes and visualizes feature importance to interpret model decisions.
